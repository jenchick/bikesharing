# bikesharing:  NY Citibike with Tableau
## Overview:
Explain the purpose of this analysis.
 there is still some more work to be done to convince investors that a bike-sharing program in Des Moines is a solid business proposal. To solidify the proposal, one of the key stakeholders would like to see a bike trip analysis.

To prepare this analysis, I used Pandas to change the "tripduration" column from an integer to a datetime datatype and then exported the new csv in order to create the visualizations. 

## Results
Describe the results/key outcomes of each visualization underneath the image/pitch to investors.

### length of time that bikes are checked out for all riders and genders
