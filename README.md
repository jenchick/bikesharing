# bikesharing:  NY Citibike with Tablequ
## Background:

Now that we've gotten a good idea of how to create our story, there is still some more work to be done to convince investors that a bike-sharing program in Des Moines is a solid business proposal. To solidify the proposal, one of the key stakeholders would like to see a bike trip analysis.

For this analysis, you’ll use Pandas to change the "tripduration" column from an integer to a datetime datatype. Then, using the converted datatype, you’ll create a set of visualizations to:

Show the length of time that bikes are checked out for all riders and genders
Show the number of bike trips for all riders and genders for each hour of each day of the week
Show the number of bike trips for each type of user and gender for each day of the week.
Finally, you’ll add these new visualizations to the two you created in this module for your final presentation and analysis to pitch to investors.


## Deliverable 1: Change Trip Duration to a Datetime Format
Using Python and Pandas functions, you’ll convert the "tripduration" column from an integer to a datetime datatype to get the time in hours, minutes, and seconds (00:00:00). After you convert the "tripduration" column to a datetime dataytpe, you’ll export the DataFrame as a CSV file to use for the trip analysis in Deliverable 2.

## Deliverable 2: Create Visualizations for the Trip Analysis
Using Tableau, create visualizations that show:

How long bikes are checked out for all riders and genders.
How many trips are taken by the hour for each day of the week, for all riders and genders.
A breakdown of what days of the week a user might be more likely to check out a bike, by type of user and gender.

## Deliverable 3: Create a Story and Report for the Final Presentation
create a story in Tableau and write a report that describes the key outcomes of the NYC Citibike analysis you did in the module and in Deliverable 2.
