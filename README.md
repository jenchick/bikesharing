NY Citibike with Tablequ


Deliverable 1: Change Trip Duration to a Datetime Format
Using Python and Pandas functions, you’ll convert the "tripduration" column from an integer to a datetime datatype to get the time in hours, minutes, and seconds (00:00:00). After you convert the "tripduration" column to a datetime dataytpe, you’ll export the DataFrame as a CSV file to use for the trip analysis in Deliverable 2.

Deliverable 2: Create Visualizations for the Trip Analysis
Using Tableau, create visualizations that show:

How long bikes are checked out for all riders and genders.
How many trips are taken by the hour for each day of the week, for all riders and genders.
A breakdown of what days of the week a user might be more likely to check out a bike, by type of user and gender.

Deliverable 3: Create a Story and Report for the Final Presentation
create a story in Tableau and write a report that describes the key outcomes of the NYC Citibike analysis you did in the module and in Deliverable 2.
